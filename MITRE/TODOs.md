# TODOs

* Add system performance impact implication in context to all the rules
* Add severity level in context to each rule. The severity level could be judged based on:
	* How many APTs have used this technique? This info is available on MITRE website.
	* Subjective assessment of the impact if the attack technique succeeds.
* There should be an easy way of whitelisting processes/files in existing policies.
